3.	Restaurant Reservation
<br>
Dineinlater.com helps diners secure reservations at restaurants. The availability of reservations is determined at the time of the user’s query. Once the reservation is made, the restaurants are automatically updated.
Only a registered user is able to make reservations at restaurants via dineinlater.com. When a registered user makes a confirmed reservation from dineinlater.com, dineinlater.com will send you an email confirming receipt of your reservation and containing the details of your reservation. Your reservation is deemed confirmed when we send an e-mail confirmation to you (the "Confirmation E-mail"). The acceptance will be complete at the time we send the Confirmation E-mail to you. Any reservations which we have not confirmed in the Confirmation E-mail do not form part of that contract.
If you are not able to honour your reservation, you may cancel your reservation online or call the restaurant directly. We ask that your cancellation be done in as timely a manner as possible and be at least an hour before your reservation. In cases of large party reservations, you may be required to cancel your reservation in accordance with the restaurants cancellation policies.
If you fail to show up for your reservation, an email will be sent to you informing you of your no-show. Your records will be updated for the no-show and your account will be suspended if you no-show for four reservations within the same twelve month period. If you receive a no-show email in error, please click here for more information on how to dispute it. You agree that all final no-show determinations will be made by Metrochow in its sole discretion.
For contractual purposes, a registered user consents to receive communications from us electronically and agrees that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that Metrochow provides to the registered user electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
